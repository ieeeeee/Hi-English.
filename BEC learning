In 1954, two brothers ran a small, but busy, restaurant in San Bernardino, California.
The restaurant featured a limited menu that included: hamburgers, French fries, soft drinks and milkshakes.
The milkshakes were very popular and the restaurant had purchased(购买) ten special "Multimixer" milkshake makers.
Each one could mix five milkshakes at a time. 
A salesman named Ray Kroc was the exclusive distributor of the "Multimixer" milkshake machines at that time,
Ray decided to visit the restaurant;
he wanted to find out why they had so many machines.
Ray talked to Richard and Maurice McDonald, the owners of the restaurant.
He saw how they prepared the food using equipment that they had invented.
The service in the restaurant was fast and the price was inexpensive.
Ray realized that this was a fantastic opportunity.
He wanted to open more restaurants and so sell more multimixers.
In April 1955, Ray opened his first franchised McDonald's restaurant in Des Plaines, lllnois.
First day sales were $366.12.
Ray continued  to franchise new restaurants and to expand. 
In 1961, he bought the business from the McDonald brothers for $2.7 million.
Today, McDonald's Corporation has over 31,000 restaurants in over 100 countries.
There is even one in Kuwait City, which opened in 1994.
On the first day, there were 15,000 people lining up to eat at the restaurant.
