What kind of rubbish are you?
This question might normally provoke anger, but in Shanghai it has elicited weary groans over the past week.
On July 1st the city introduced stringet trash-sorting regulations that are expected to be used as a model for the country.
Residents must divide their waste into four separate categories and toss it into specific public bins. 
They must do so at scheduled times, 
when monitors are present to ensure compliance (and to inquire into the nature of one's rubbish.)
Violaters face the prospect of fines and worse.
Shanghai authorities are responding to an obvious environment problem.
It gemerates 9m tonnes of garbage a year, more than London's annual output and rising quickly.
But like other cities in China, it lacks a recycling system.
Instead, it has relied on trash pickers to sift through the waste, plucking out whatever can be reused.
This has limits.
As people get wealthier, fewer of them want to do such dirty work.
The waste, meanwhile, just keeps piling up.
China churns out 80bn pairs of disposable chopsticks a year.
