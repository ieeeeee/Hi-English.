What kind of rubbish are you?
This question might normally provoke anger, but in Shanghai it has elicited weary groans over the past week.
On July 1st the city introduced stringet trash-sorting regulations that are expected to be used as a model for the country.
Residents must divide their waste into four separate categories and toss it into specific public bins. 
They must do so at scheduled times, 
when monitors are present to ensure compliance (and to inquire into the nature of one's rubbish.)
Violaters face the prospect of fines and worse.
Shanghai authorities are responding to an obvious environment problem.
It generates 9m tonnes of garbage a year, more than London's annual output and rising quickly.
But like other cities in China, it lacks a recycling system.
Instead, it has relied on trash pickers to sift through the waste, plucking out whatever can be reused.
This has limits.
As people get wealthier, fewer of them want to do such dirty work.
The waste, meanwhile, just keeps piling up.
China churns out 80bn pairs of disposable chopsticks a year.

Have you ever got a feeling like you've seen it before while scrolling through comics?
Let's be real, it was probabliy in your own life!
We are all so individual and different, we come from different cultures and backgrounds,
yet we find ourselves in funny circumstance that seem to be exactly the same.
Life is full of challenges and surprises but the best you can do in the most ridiculous and obscure situations is to laugh at them!
Out of 7 billion people in the world, 
there are lots who are on the same page and can totally relate to your experiences and laugh at them together.
This is what artist Bella Sriwantana is counting on by sharing quirky comics about her daily life.
She opens up struggles, and relationships with a great deal of self-irony and humor.

you can't(don't need to) please anyone.

There O' Cat is Still a Game
What do I believe? What laws do I live by?
There are so many answers-work, beauty, truth, love- and I hope I do live by them.
But in everyday things I live by the light of a supplementary (附加)set of laws. 
I'd better call them rules of thumb.经验法则
Rules of thumb aren't very grand, but they do make the wheels go around.
My father and mother send me to good schools, but the finest thing they did for my education was to have seven children.
I was the oldest, and my brothers and sisters were my best teachers.
I learned first to pull my own weight in the boat.
Kids making a bob-sled have no use for the loafer who wants a free ride.
Neither has the world.
I learned to make the bed I slept in, and wash the glass I used, and mend what I broke, and mop up where i spilled.
And if I was too lazy or too dainty or too busy, and left it for someone else, somebody else soon taught me different.
Then, the same way, I learned that anger is a waste.
It hurts nobody but me.
A fit of the sullens got short shrift in our house.
It wasn't pulling my weight in the boat, it was spoiling sport.
And among seven children it got me nowhere.
It might reduce four o'cat to three o'cat, but the game went on just the same, and where was I? Out of it.
Better go in and join the group around the piano and forget my grievance.
Better still, next time don't filing down my bat in a tantrum;
keep my temper, and stay in the game.
