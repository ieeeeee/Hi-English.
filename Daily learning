"Maybe" she said. She turend back around and walked quickly toward one of the campus buildings.
I wanted to run after her, but I wanted to be cool, too. Don't be too eager. 急切
Girls don't like guys who are too eager, I reminded myself, she is the kind girl that I could lose my head over.
I wondered that what her name was.Maybe I'll see her tomorrow, I really hope so.
I rushed home after my last class ended at 6:30
There was a lot of traffic there and i didn't get home at 7:00.
I was late.
As I opened the door front of the house, I heared a woman's voice
Aunt April was already here
Poor Uncle Jeff. 
It's hard to face Aunt April alone.
she is a force of nature,a tornado or a tidal way 她是大自然，龙卷风或潮汐的力量

There are only two kinds of people who are fascinating, people who know absolutely everything, and people who know absolutely nothing.

Nothing seek,nothing find.

Life's like a movie, write your own ending. Keep believing, keep pretending.

Everything comes to you in the right moment. Be patient. Be grateful.

Knowledge will give you power, but character respect.
